# Intrusion-Detection-ConvNet-model-TensorFlow-Keras-DeepLearning-Library-
Intrusion Detection/ Anomaly Detection is designed with python to detect objects coming into the network. 
That would involve using the ConvNet model, using TensorFlow and Keras (Deep learning library for python) packages, and Keras is used to sit on top of TensorFlow. 
The datasets provided are USNW-NB15, NSL-KDD(TRAIN) and NSLKDD(TEST), both of which are the same. 
The following measurements that would be followed for the test of the anomaly detection would be Detection Rate (DR), False Alarm Rate (FAR) and accuracy (Acc%). 
The DR refers to the rate of the intrusion example; detection from the IDS model, FAR refers to the rate of the normal examples which are brought into the wrong categories 
(Liu, Y., Liu, S. and Zhao, X., 2017), the accuracy, would be on how accurate the algorithm is at detecting the anomaly.
